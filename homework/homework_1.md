## homework 1 - choose your own adventure

have you ever read a choose your own adventure (cyoa) book? they look like this guy right here:

or maybe goosebumps is more your flavor:

if you haven't read these kinds of books (or it's just been awhile), let me tell you have they work: the basic idea is that you read a page, and at the end of the page they give you a choice.  you can either turn to one page, and something happens, or turn to another page, and something else happens.

for example, a page in a cyoa book might look like this:

> you have fallen down a hungry dragon's gullet!  things are starting to get very cramped and very sweaty.  what do you do?
>
> turn to page 45 to draw your sword
>
> turn to page 90 to draw upon your dark magic

your task, should you choose to accept it (which you do, if you want a good grade), is to make your own cyoa using `html`.
