# homework 1 - choose your own adventure (due 9/29)

have you ever read a choose your own adventure (cyoa) book? they look like this guy right here:

or maybe goosebumps is more your flavor:

if you haven't read these kinds of books (or it's just been awhile), let me tell you how they work: the basic idea is that you read a page, and at the end of the page they give you a choice.  you can either turn to one page, and something happens, or turn to another page, and something else happens.

for example, a page in a cyoa book might look like this:

> you have fallen down a hungry dragon's gullet!  things are starting to get very cramped and very sweaty.  what do you do?
>
> turn to page 45 to draw your sword
>
> turn to page 90 to draw upon your dark magic

your task, should you choose to accept it (which you do, if you want a good grade), is to make your own cyoa using `html`.

## directions

* create a new page in your `pages` folder called `cyoa.html`
* create a mini-story with multiple options, just like the example above
* instead of turning to pages, have each option be a link to another page in your `pages` folder
* make sure you have links to at least **five different pages**.
* make sure that all your pages use all of the following tags:
  1. `<h1></h1>` (any size)
  2. `<p></p>`
  3. `<img>` (at least one picture per page)
  4. `<div></div>`
  5. `<hr>`
  6. `<a></a>`
* submit a link to your `cyoa.html` on [this page](https://docs.google.com/a/citycharterschools.org/forms/d/1AD0OK_p00y98UfO0xhwJZ1oXv0K6EDa1xfpmWFzhbso/viewform)
