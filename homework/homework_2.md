the point of a blog post is to tell the reader about some topic, whether it be your life, your interests, the sad lack of dragons in the world, or otherwise.

in this assignment, you'll be creating your own blog post using HTML and CSS. at the same time. wowzer.

## directions
* choose a topic for your blog post. like i mentioned earlier, it can be about anything! have you been reading a great book lately? i want to hear all about it. have you ever dreamed of traveling to paris? let me know what you love about paris. do you just *really* love john cena? now's the time to tell me about him, out of NOWHERE.

* The blog post should have:
  * a **header area**, where the title of the blog post goes
  * the **content area**, where all the images and text of the blog post are
  * the **footer area**, where you'll put your (made up!) contact information
    * **NOTE:** each of these areas should be inside of its own `<div>` tag


* the content area should have multiple header and paragraph tags. add some styles for each tag type, making sure to only use the `<style>` tag for CSS (that means **no inline-styling!**).

* give each `<div>` its own `id` attribute (`"header"`, `"content"` and `"footer"`), and style each a little. for example, they could each have a different background color.
  * make sure you also use at least one `class` attribute on one of your HTML tags


* if you're wondering what CSS properties you can use, check out [this]() cheatsheet!
