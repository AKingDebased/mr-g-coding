# what a long strange trip it's been

well, here we are. the last assignment. it's been a great time. we've had the best of times, and the worst of [times](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/A_Tale_of_Two_Cities). our ship has weather'd every rack, the prize we sought is [won](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O_Captain!_My_Captain!).

almost.

## directions
* this last assignment will be a portfolio showcasing all the work you've done this year. it will pull together everything you've learned in coding class: all the html, all the css, and all your [gumption](http://www.thefreedictionary.com/gumption).

* you will create a website that includes all of the following:
  * a home page that talks about you, what you learned in coding class, and **links** to every single assignment you've completed this year. think of it both like an intro to your portfolio as well as a table of contents, with each chapter being another one of your assignments. you should be linking to:
    * html basics classwork, i.e. the about me page
    * html basics homework, i.e. the cyoa
    * css basics pt. 1 & 2, i.e. the dream vacation (you can't really link to part 2, so we'll call it all one big assignment)
    * css basics homework, i.e. the blog post
    * any extra pages that show off all the skills you've picked up (you'll earn **extra credit** for each additional page you add)
  * **every single html tag and css style we've talked about**. all of them. this includes, but is not limited to:
    * `<img>`
    * `<ol>` & `<ul>`
    * `<div>`
    * if you've forgotten any html tags or css styles we've discussed, be sure to check out [lesson 2](../lessons/02_html_basics.md) and [lesson 3](../lessons/03_css_basics.md), or ask me any time.
  * a design that only uses the `<style>` tag, tag selectors, classes, and IDs. there should be absolutely **no inline styles**. if you've forgotten what any of those words mean, check out [lesson 3](../lessons/03_css_basics.md), or feel free to ask me any time.

## example

* check out my sample portfolio [here](https://preview.c9users.io/akingdebased/mr-g-coding/index.html?_c9_id=livepreview0&_c9_host=https://ide.c9.io)!
  * **remember**: you can right click on any web page and select `view page source` to see its HTML and CSS code
  * your portfolio does not need to look exactly like this. in fact, it should NOT just be a copy/paste of my page, or else you will receive **no credit**. use my example for inspiration!
