## getting started

### setting up codio

in order to create websites, you're gonna need a text editor and somewhere to store all your files.  since we're using chrome books, we don't have the luxury of downloading a text editor and storing our files on our computer.  instead, we'll be using a super neat service called [codio](https://codio.com/).

codio is an online **IDE**, or **integrated development environment**.  that's a lot of words that mean something super simple: codio is a place we can go to write and store code.  boom, there you go.

so how do we use it?  you know, i am so glad you asked.  first off, you're gonna have to sign up.  you do that by going to [codio](https://codio.com/), and clicking the big, old `SIGN UP` button in the top right. once you do that, you should see this guy right here:

![do you see this? sign up.  now.](http://i.imgur.com/uvMSUt8.png)

go ahead and sign up with your city charter school email.  your username can be anything you like (just, you know, keep it PG).  once you've successfully created your account, you'll need to check the email you signed up with for a verification email.  once you've gotten your email verified, come back to codio.  you should see this:

![you should see this.  please.](http://i.imgur.com/bJXO604.png)

once there, you're gonna wanna click that nice, blue `NEW PROJECT` button in the top right.  this will pop up:

![are you seeing this? you should be.](http://i.imgur.com/p917iHn.png)

all you need to do is give your project a name, and click `CREATE`.  **that's it**.  you don't have to click **anything else**.  your project name can be whatever you like; i suggest something descriptive, like `mr g coding`.

if you've done it right, you'll see this screen:

![good god, i think you've done it](http://i.imgur.com/3tOXntD.png)

and that's it!  you have done it.  codio is set up.  give yourself a round of applause.  you've earned it.

### the file structure

you are so close to readiness.  all you need to do now is set up your files correctly.
