### setting up codio

in order to create websites, you're gonna need a text editor and somewhere to store all your files.  since we're using chrome books, we don't have the luxury of downloading a text editor and storing our files on our computer.  instead, we'll be using a super neat service called [codio](https://codio.com/).

codio is an online **IDE**, or **integrated development environment**.  that's a lot of words that mean something super simple: codio is a place we can go to write and store code.  boom, there you go.
